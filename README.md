# Fossora

Fossora makes it simple to build highly fault-tolerant home mesh networks for running containerized services. In simpler terms, Fossora is a piece of software you can install on any number of your computers, which provides a web interface for you to run network apps (think jellyfin, plex, etc) across those machines. The unique offering of Fossora is that it ensures if one of your computers dies, needs to have a new OS installed, or crashes, your services and Fossora remains available. Fossora is designed to be simple, install a binary onto a machine that has docker installed, and it will instantly network with other devices on your network also running Fossora. When run in tandem with a tool like Tailscale, Fossora will work to automatically configure custom DNS and reverse proxy settings such that you can access all of your services by their name, instead of their port number. In this post, I want to elaborate on the design of Fossora, and jump into how it leverages Tailscale in its discovery algorithm.
